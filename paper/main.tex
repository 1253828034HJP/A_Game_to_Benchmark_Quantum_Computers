\title{Benchmarking of quantum processors with random circuits}

\begin{abstract}

Quantum processors with sizes in the 10-100 qubit range are now commonplace. However, with increased size comes increased complexity for benchmarking. The effectiveness of a given device may vary greatly between different tasks, and wonâ€™t always be  easy to predict from single and two qubit gate fidelities. For this reason, it is important to assess processor quality for a range of important tasks. In this work we propose and implement tests based on random quantum circuits. These are used to evaluate four different superconducting qubit devices, with sizes from 5 to 19 qubits, from three hardware manufacturers: IBM Research, Rigetti and Alibaba.
